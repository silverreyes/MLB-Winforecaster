# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Produce well-calibrated win probability estimates that can be rigorously compared against Kalshi market prices, surfacing where models agree, disagree, and where edges may exist.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Data Ingestion and Raw Cache

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Four-phase structure following strict data pipeline dependency chain (ingest -> features -> models -> market comparison)
- [Roadmap]: Live prediction pipeline deferred to v2 (requires all v1 components proven first)
- [Roadmap]: MODEL and EVAL requirements combined into Phase 3 (evaluation is inseparable from training -- together they answer "do the models work?")

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: pandas must stay at 2.2.x (not 3.0) due to pybaseball incompatibility with PyArrow string dtypes
- [Research]: Kalshi historical data only available from 2025 -- Phase 4 comparison limited to ~1 season
- [Research]: 2020 60-game season may need exclusion or era-flagging -- decision needed during Phase 1
